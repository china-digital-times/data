All the words and deeds involved are my personal behaviors and have nothing to do with others. I will full responsibility for this. Please do not bother the innocent people since such actions are to be despised, and shall not work.</p>\n<p>Hereby I make this declaration.</p>\n<p>Wang Ruiqin</p>\n","author":1069,"categories":[18271,38912,38960,38985,39270],"tags":[8974,9526,13222,40950,8908,21903,40948,40949]}
